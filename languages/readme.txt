=== How To Translate Amber ===

== I want Amber to be available in my language. How can I help? ==

WordPress makes crowdsourcing translations easy. It uses [GlotPress](https://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/), a tool to help translators collaborate. You can find detailed contributor documentation in the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

To submit translations for Amber, go to the [Amber plugin homepage][https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/amberlink/](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/amberlink/).
